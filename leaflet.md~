## The `leaflet` package

The [package](http://leafletjs.com/) is an open-source JavaScript library for mobile-friendly interactive maps. We can make interactive panning/zooming and overlay object on maps:

- Map tiles.
- Markers (with custom icons).
- Polygons.
- Lines.
- Popups.
- GeoJSON.
- Choropleth maps.
- Non-geographical maps.
- WMS and TMS (weather and time measurement systems).
- Map panes.
- Videos.

We can embed maps in R Markdown documents and Shiny apps. We can embed maps into websites.

We can render spatial objects from the sp or sf packages, or data frames with latitude/longitude columns.

With `leftlet` grammar, we can build a set of overlays with the `magrittr` pipe operator (`%>%`).

Consult the documentation and the [website](http://leafletjs.com/) for the specifics.

## Embedding with `<iframe>` or `<embed>`

<iframe seamless src="../leaflet.html" width=600px height=400px ></iframe>

<embed seamless src="../leaflet.html" width=600px height=400px ></embed>

## Embedding

Leaflet is a JavaScript library. JavaScript should be the prime language for creating maps and embedding them into web sites.

However, we can also publish [web sites]() or build a [flexdashboard](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/flexdashboard/). These tools seamlessly integrate interactive htmlwidgets along with static visualizations (and optionally use Shiny to drive visualizations dynamically).

A flexdashboard is an alternative to an HTML report, using other formats than 'pages' or 'slides'.

[bookdown](https://bookdown.org/) is a static document that do not take interactive and dynamic tools.
