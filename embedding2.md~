## Stand-alone .Rdm document

Normally, we would create a stand-alone document with a header; the settings determine the output style and appearance:

```
---
title: "Document only"
output: html_document
---
```

## Embedding .Rmd sub-documents into a .Rmd document

It is also possible to create sub-document to be called in the main document.

The sub-documents have to headers, no settings, simply Markdown text strings and code chunks.

The main document has a header and settings to be applied to the main document and its children.

Within the main document, we call sub-documents with this code chunk (the sub-document path and filename):


	```{r, child="sub1.Rmd"}
	```


We can add extra options: `eval=FALSE`, `echo=FALSE`, `include=FALSE`, etc. to bypass the main settings.

We can compile the sub-document to test them.

We compile the main document to wrap up the complete document.
